**Accounting Profit before tax** : This is the profit before tax. It is calculated by deducting all the expenses from the revenue. This is the figure that we see in the income Statement. But the tax is not calculated on this figure


**Taxable Income** : This is the income on which we calculate the tax. It removes non-taxable expenses from the tax rate like Depreciation + other deductions etc


So even a negative PBT can lead to positive taxable income and a positive tax rate
