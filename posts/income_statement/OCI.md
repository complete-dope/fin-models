# Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)

**Remeasurement of defined benefit plans** : It includes pensions, gratuity fund and can vary year to year.


**Equity Instruments through OCI** : Company buys shares of another company for long term and shows them in OCI so it doesnt affect the companies P&L 


**Income Tax on above items** : Tax effects related to OCI items are also recorded in OCI to ensure the after-tax impact is clear.


**Share of OCI in Associate & JV** : 

### Joint Venture:

**Honda and LG Energy Solutions** formed a joint venture in 2022 to build a Lithium-Iron battery. And this is jointly controlled seperate entity


### Associate:
1. **Toyota and Subaru** deal, where Toyota has acquired 16.8% stake in Subaru Corporation, this relationship helps both companies to collaborate on vehicle development projects and Toyota doesn't have a controlling interest.

2.  **Microsoft has invested $100 million in Uber technologies** and this gives Microsoft a minority stake and an influence, the operational part everything remains over to Uber.


The gains and losses of associates and JV's also need to be reflected in the comprehensive income according to law
