# Banking sector 

Thrives on LDR , loan to deposit ratio, how much loan has the bank given in comparison to how much they got the deposit for 

Then try to maintain it at 83% , so they have enough cash for people and also for NPA they accumulate 

> Important : Q1 in general , Election year 2024 , loan collectors / recovery team couldn't get collect loans in that quarter from rural and semi urban areas ( because they will blame govt and might not vote ) so they start that part in 2nd quarter .. 

Regulatory obligation for banks like RIDF bonds and PSLC's 

Banks are required to provide a certain amount of loans to the priority sector that includes agriculture , rural and semi urban areas

and if they are not met then they have to buy:  

1. RIDF bonds : 
2. PSLC bonds : Priority sector lending certificates


Cost to income ratio :
So currently bank take around 45% as the operational costs and we need to bring that down to 30%, 

```
CRB : credit rating bureau
CASA : Current account savings account
```

**Current account** : For businesses it's interest rate is at 0%
**Saving account** : For individuals, pays low interest around 2-4%

**Term deposits**: Customers lock in money for a certain period and banks pay them high interest (6-7%)  / FD's 

So ideally banks wants to increase CASA to get there profits sorted out and want to reduce or protect the margins ..
