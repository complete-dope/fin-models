# Other Equity

**Capital Redemption Reserve (CRR)** : Reserve created when company buys back / redeems its own shares or  preference shares using the profit it made, it reduces its share capital for other investors / external investors. So that goes out as special reserve called Capital Redemption Reserve (CRR).  The main purpose is to keep these funds as liquidity 

Capital Act law says "if you reduce your equity-capital, then create an equal amount of CRR(Capital Redemption Reserve) from your profits"

This cant be used for *reinvestments, borrowing , etc* .. need to be deposited in bank as Cash .. (these are highly liquid resources)


**Statutory reserve fund** : Only banks / financial institutions / NBFC are required to maintain these .. Mandatory reserve, reserve that is created from profits. It acts as a safety for depositors ( usually for nbfc and banks ) 
RBI says to keep 20% of the net profit to this reserve.
So year-1 investments have 0 in SRF , and the profit earned from it 20% of that profit needs to go to SRR

This amount can be deposited to *low risk liquid assets like government securities*, which are liquid but less liquid than CRR 


**Securities premium** : Premium on new shares issued, more than their face value this extra money is called securities premium/ 

FV = 10 
Market price = 200 

and company issued : 1,00,000 new shares 
200 * 1,00,000 => which amount to a total of 2,00,00,000

10 * 1,00,000 => 10,00,000 is the Share Capital 
190 * 1,00,000 => 190,00,000 is the Securities Premium 

Its can also come under capital reserve 
This can be used for reinvestments , expansions, growth but this money cant be used to payout direct dividend

**Capital Reserve** : Profits that dont come from regular business activities, usually one time or special profits

Asset bought price = 1,00,000
Asset sold price = 8,00,000
