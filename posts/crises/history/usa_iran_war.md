## Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia and how they started ? 

> Everything's peaceful till 1979


### Why would US invade Iran ? 

Top-3 reasons why a war could break out: 

**Israel lobby**: Millions of Christian Zionists believe that if all the Jews are in Israel and Israel gets the right they deserve then Jesus will come back and the world will be saved.

**Empire** : US is an empire , and US-ukraine war really tarnished its image and to come back to the status of empire they need to do something big and enter war

**Saudi Arabia and Iran** : Both are rivals ? why ? Before 1979 , they were friends both were monarchs and OPEC's and in 1979 political uproar , and 3 things came that lead to Islamic revolution

```
> Remove monarchy establish a Islamic republic
> US should be involved in our internal affairs 
> Islamic law 
```

And in wake of upright, 600 extremist entered in Saudi-Arabia ( where both mecca and meddiah ) are located and demanded the same 3 rules for saudi also .. 
There revolt was crushed by army and from that time a war began between saudi and iran and both the countries are in a cold-war since then 


## Reasons for tiff between Iran and Saudi Arabia : 

### Religion

SA: Sunni Muslim   
Iran: Shia Muslim  

610BC : Prophet Muhammad formed Islam , and when he died his succession has a problem , 
Sunni thought anyone who is capable should be the leader, whereas shia thought only the bloodline of prophet should be the leader

This divide also caused a tiff 

And the Haj , where its belived each muslim should go to mecca and madiah at least once in their life time , this makes SA as a leader in islamic world   

In response, Iran said saudi is ruled by king / monarch that's anti muslim and also its ruled by US that's also its anti muslim 

SA practices most extreme form of Sunni, called wahhabism

1744 : Wahhabism collaborated with SA govt to establish it as a religion 

In , 1930 oil was discovered in SA and the most valuable oil reserve in the world. And this bought prosperity in SA and soon they started shifting to the modern standards aka western standards. And this shift was not accepted by wahhabism and this led to the seige in mecca. 

Osama bin laden was a wahhabist and he was a saudi national and was responsible to spread wahhabism in the Afganistan.

Iran is exporting Shia religion, SA is exporting Wahhabism and they are competing and fighting 


### Economic conflict

SA no tax gets revenue from export of Oil and control the global price which leads to higher prices for them 

But Iran doesn't cooperate in this and they have diversed their economy , they have human capital , edcuated people, science , etc .. 


### Geopolitical reasons
Iran is asserting its dominance and SA want to assert its dominance so that's why they are cooperating ... 


US and SA provoked Iraq to invade Iran  in 1980 and this is known as the Iran-Iraq war

**Proxy war -1**  
In 2003, US invaded Iraq ( why?? ) and its had a power vaccuum and Iran took advantage of this power vaccuum and started to assert its dominance in the region as the 2/3 people in Iraq were shia and 1/3 were Sunni and SA started funding this 1/3 people and this lead to civil war in the iraq and they are considered responsible for creating ISIS .. 


**Proxy war -2**
War in Syria, Iran and Russia allied  , and SA , Israel,  US allied and Iran won at end .. 

**Proxy war -3**
War in Yemen 2014 , yemen rebillion were shia and they attacked rebillion in Yemen, Shock and all, so many bombs , army .. but this didn't work because of the geography , houthis are covered by mountains and they are were blowing up the SA oil fields using cheap drones .. 
So 3 things SA learned from this: 

```
> Extremely vulnerable to attack anytime Iran wants can attack SA 
> Its easy to destroy them due to there oil and desalination plants ( they rely on removing salt from sea water )
> They need US to protect them and go to war for us.
```

2001, 9/11 attack 15 of the 19 hijackers were from SA and America was in war with SA and some tiff strted 

2017, NBS , young progressive, 2030 and became friends with Trump and remade ties with America. 

2020 Trump made decision to assasinate Qasem Soleimani, the leader of Iran's Quds force, a special forces unit that is responsible for Iran's military operations outside of Iran ( he is the one that led all the civil wars)

Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was a senior adviser to Trump, was the one who negotiated the deal to Middle east and NBS controlled him and he is good friend of NBS and he was the one who convinced Trump to assassinate Soleimani


So SA wants to remove Iran from Map, and Israel is in war with Iran and middle east due to rebel group of hamas and heezbollah and they are also supported by Iran 

And they both want Trump to win 2020 election and do this !! 

### Trump winning in Nov. 2024


Biden won in 2020, 91% black people voted for Biden. 
Standards of people have dropped down from 2020-2024 and US dollar is going to war that had nothing to do with US ... 

Kamala harris, similar to people from suburbs .. 
Joe biden picked Kamala as VP 
Opinion about trump is he is less mature than a 5 year old


## How did Iranian president died ? 

3 major problems : 
1. Information more , truth less 
2. disinformation more , information less
3. Fake news more , truth less


We will use Game theory to analyse the death of Ebrahim Raisi as we are not relying on the information given by media. 

He died in a helicopter accident when he was coming back from azerbaijan and all 9 people present in helicopter died . 

> old helicopter
> frequently people die in crash ( kobe bryant )

But Game Theory forces us to explore more possibilities:


2 more possibilities could be there .. 

> foreign adversary , either US , israel maybe azerbaijan , had a reason to kill him. Israel killed nuclear scientists before + US killed iranian top military commander before. 

> Someone inside Iran wanted to kill him 

 
3 helicopters were coming back and only his helicopter crashed and the other 2 helicopters landed safely. (strange)

President in Iran is a CEO , and supreme leader is the one that runs the country 
So Ebrahim was supposed to become the next supreme leader once the current supreme leader dies.


Who would not want that to happen?
Someone who is 2nd in race ... 2nd in race is the son of current supreme leader 

But Iranians don't like hereditary ( they fought for that in 1979) so people dont want him to become the next supreme leader.

IRGC ( Iran revolutionary guard corpse) there role is to protect the revolution ( aka supreme leader ) and to spread the revolution in the whole of middle east 

Saddam hussian from Iraq was motivated by many interests of people to go war with Iran and this was a brutal war where he died in 1980 and was called Iran - Iraq war

IRGC is the one that killed Saddam hussian. There power rised in country and they became one of the most dominant group in Iran and they control around 10=20% of the economy. People dont like them as they are violent and massive protests have been seen against them.

What would happen if someone else take's place of supreme leader ? He will try to reduce the power of IRGC and will establish his own power. BUT if the son of supreme leader is the one that takes , he wont take over our power, the situation is solved .. 


Protest took out and in 1979 , students made US embassy as hostage and when read the classified they got to know the real power is in the embassy not the govt.,  

1953, US embassy was the one that overthrew the government and put back the king shah.
and now the people are not happy with the US and they want US to get out from Iran at any cost. 


Iran has proxies all over Middle east, Hezbolla , youthis , hamas, shia-iraqi militants , syria-militants 
and they want to provoke war with US and somehow want them to enter to there countries to attack .
