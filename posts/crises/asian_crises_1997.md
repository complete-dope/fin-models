Currency Devaluation : Its an intention reduction in the value of a country's currency relative to other currencies usually carreid out by the central bank. Done for countries which have fixed exchange rate systems. 

After 1991, India managed floating exchange rate system.

For example : If a country pegs its currency to the US dollar, it might change the peg from 1:1 to 2:1, meaning it now takes twice as much local currency to buy one US dollar.

Speculative attacks : People in a fixed exchange somehow analysed that the country's own currency is lower that what the fixed rate has been, means that's an arbitrage, they are getting dollars at cheap price so people depleted the foreign exchange reserves of the country.

This lead to country devaluing the currency !!

Corporates that bought loans in baht and now had to pay back in more baht to repay it, more expensive loan, leading to default.

Investors lost confidence, debt burdens increased, bank loan defaulted this all lead to a deep recession


Not always devaluation leads to a bad outcome, if done when the foreign debts are low, strong financial system, its helps to balance trade deficit as export becomes cheaper and imports become expensive.
