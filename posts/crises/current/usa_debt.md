# USA debt and methods that it uses to overcome it 

Debt / GDP ratio 

Here GDP means Nominal GDP, which is just total value of goods/services at market prices
> *Important* : If the country produces same amount of goods ( lets say 100kg rice ) in both years 2020 and 2021 and inflation rate increases by 10% in year-2 ( rest all factors remain same ), the GDP increases by 10% in 2021. So we can say market price includes effect of inflation. This also decrease the intrinsic value of debt. As same amt of future money is worth less than present money.



In 1945 the ratio peaked at 113-126%  
In 2020 the ratio peaked at 130-134% 
In 2024 ratio is at 124-130% 


Average GDP composition for US
Services : 79.9
Industry : 19.1
Agri : 1.2

So lets see how US debt increase and methods they take to overcome it and how the citizens react to it .. 

> The most interesting thing about debt is the *repayment* cycle of debt .. the timeline of repayment and how it is repaid. Is there any restructuring happening ? Is the country increasing the deadline to pay the debt ? Can the country even pay it ? How are lenders reacting to it ?

* Debt is repaid using the taxes collected , revenue collected from states + taxes + etc. 

At that time US had around 10-20 years to repay the loan .. and the debt funded industrial expansion and victory; post-war growth reduced it.



## Buildup : Great depression ( 1929-1943 )

GD Started from 1929 and ended in 1941, homeless ,jobless people , no contribution to economy , GDP reduced and govt programmes(medicare, education) costs debt, so debt / gdp ratio increased .. 

GDP shrank 43% (1929–1933), slashing tax income while relief costs soared, reducing GDP as valued services reduced

Interest rates slashed which led to no income from country 

So the initial debt came from this depression and then its was the WW-2 that increased the debt

## Main : World war 2 ( 1941-1967 )

**Pre-war buildup** : 
US provided 50 billion dollars to UK and France to fight germany and japan and then officially entered in 1941, US defense spending tripled and US debt increased. This debt was taken from FED, Banks, and citizens aka war bonds ( patriot bonds )

**WW-2** : Direct cost 1.5x 1940's  GDP . Citizen bought 185 billion dollars in bonds known as victory bonds.
So debt increased from 43% of GDP in 1939 to 126% in 1945

Factories were retooled for tanks / aircraft funded by govt loans auto production halted GM built bombers instead of cars. Converted it to a war economy

**Post war paydown** : 
Debt / GDP ratio is at 120% , and now war is done, convert back to growth economy, interest-rate on bonds are lower... so how to lower it ? 

### Option 1 :
Default on the loans ... BUT , we are US , we are empire , we control world , this would make us weak

### Option 2 : 
Let's trick people into Financial repression and Suprise Inflation 

**Pegged Interest Rates(1942-1951)**
The Fed was forced to keep interest rates at 2.5%, no matter what.

In normal markets, interest rates go up with inflation or risk.

But here? The government said:

>“We don’t care what the market says. You’ll only earn 2.5%.”


**Interest Equalization Tax(1963)**
This tax made it costly to invest in foreign bonds.

So, rich people couldn’t escape to better returns outside the U.S.

They were trapped into buying crappy, low-yield U.S. bonds.

**Regulation Q**
Law that capped how much interest banks could give you on your deposits.

If banks can't give you more than 1%, and inflation is 4%, you're losing money.


### Results of all this ? 

Real interest rates were negative, US quietly reduced the debt by screwing savers,  pension funds and anyone holding fixed income instruments.



**Suprise Inflation** 
Inflation increased by 17.6% in 1946-47 , 9.5% in 1947-48
Reasons which led to increase in inflation : 
1. Factories from tanks to toasters ( slowly reviving production ) 
2. Soldiers back from war -> wants goods
3. Money in ecosystem , more money in economy , less products , higher prices ,inflation , artifically boosted inflation ( can be done by adding more money )


**Benefits from inflation**
Prices of goods increased, corporates profits goes up , tax revenue increased 
Wages rise -> income tax collection goes up 
Nominal GDP increased (see important note at top) , debt / gdp ratio decreased


### Economic growth 


Real GDP grew 3.8% annually from 1943-1973, outpacing debt accumulation 

*Postwar industrial boom* , *Productivity gains*

What all favoured economic growth ? 
1. Young workers, cold war with Soviet Union, competition 
2. 
3. 



## How people started thinking about the leader do they loved him after this r hated him ? How this turned out to be in favor ? 

Truman was leading it all and was reelected in the next term and was seen as a good leader as in the next term he promised progressive reforms aka fair deal. 


## Financial Crises of 2008 
Similar situation to the previous one , where debt/gdp ratio rose from 35% to 99% due to bailouts , stimulus and recession driven revenue drops 

### BuildUp 
The Bush-era tax cuts (2001, 2003) and Iraq/Afghanistan wars added $3 trillion to debt by 2008, reducing revenue while increasing military spending

Debt accumulation became easier, people took mortgage to take up there homes and were not able to pay it back, which left people homeless and banks in loans 

## Debt Hits 
The banks declared bankruptcy and near collapse of multiple other institutions and they required emergency interventions in the form of govt bailouts 

People unemployed, tax revenue dropped, production dropped,  

Unemployment + medicare services costed more to increase in debt 


## Overcoming from debt  
Same 3 strategies as in 2008

**Zero Interest Rate Policy**
* The Fed slashed interest rates to near zero by late 2008. ( this rate is the one at which banks lend to each other) 

* US Government and large financial institutions can also borrow very cheaply 

* Consumers and businesses get loans at low but not zero interest — e.g., 1% to 5%, depending on the risk.

Total debt went up but the interest on these were nil
The rich got richer in this scheme. 

Reasons to make zero interest rate: 
1. Lowers the debt servicing cost for governments so they buy money and pay less interest on its bonds

2. Encourages borrowing and spending hoping to stimulate the economy 

3. Stimulation can increase the GDP which can reduce the ratio 

**Quantitative Easing**
Govt creates govt-bond that are sold to banks in exchange for money. The FED buys some of these bonds using new money / fake money / air money from banks which leads to influx of money to the bank and bank now has liquidity to lend to people. 
The new money is not coming from something valuable its coming from the air.

🔁 It created a fake demand for U.S. debt, people thinking debt bonds are valuable — so yields stayed down, prices stayed up.

```
Example: 
Face value: $1,000

Coupon (fixed interest): $30/year

So the yield = 30 / 1000 = 3%

NOW, 

If demand for bonds increases, price goes up: people are now paying $1,050 for that bond.

The interest is still $30.

New buyer’s yield = 30 / 1050 = 2.86%
```

`Bonds price increase , yields go down, actual money is the same`
`Bonds price decrease , yields go up , actual money is the same`

Fake demand, FED is not buying from earned money its creating money out of thin air to buy them  



**Financial repression(modern version)**
Same as Regulation Q, but with a twist.
Here the FED suppressed yields so savers had no choice but to buy low-yielding government debt or jump into risk assets.

Banks and pension funds were forced by regulation to hold Treasuries.

**Mild Inflation**
Unlike 1940s, this time they couldn’t allow runaway inflation — global trust in dollar was at stake.

But ~2% annual inflation + near-zero interest = negative real returns for savers.

Increase in inflation increases the GDP no. and decrease the actual debt that needs to be repaid ..
There are debt that are *inflation-adjusted* which means that the debt is adjusted for inflation so this trick doesnt work on those debts.. 



> Core Trick : Pay off old debt with cheaper money in the future, while forcing citizens and institutions to hold your debt. 


**Stagflation**
Increasing inflation , decreasing economic growth , increasing unemployment all at the same time. 
Good for numbers but not good for economy 



## COMPARING ALL THIS WITH CURRENT SITUATION 

Trump in 2025


**Prebuild** of Debt
```
2008 bubble not fully recovered 
normalization of high debt 
```

**Main drivers**
2020 covid debt, medicare debt , all these amounting to debt addition of 5 Trillion dollars

**Post Build**
After 2023, we should have seen government being serious about the debt repayment and bringing in laws to reduce the debt but that was not the case and infact lead to they are increasing the debt more..


Jan 2 , 2025 Debt cieling was increased to 36.2T (whatever debt government had on that day), unless a new congress bill comes that increases this limit, this is the debt limit we are at ... 
 

Possible Options to reduce debt ?
* Reduce the entitlements, cut-programmes
*  





Increasing Tariff rates with countries
Reducing govt fundings to non-essential programs
Asking FED to decrease interest rates
Not participating in Wars (but proxing it)
China as a threat , competition 
```


## Using Game theory Analysis 









A fixed return (like a war bond at 2.5%), your real wealth was melting.



Stagflation : High inflation , high economic growth , high unemployment all simultaneously



--- 

debt fell to 24% of GDP by 1974 via growth , inflation and 1940-50 surpluses 

From 1947 to 1970, out of these 24 years for 22 years US revenue exceeded non-interest spending. 

*1947-1952* : Defense spending reduced , federal spending cuts , tax hikes 

*1953-1960* : Social security excluded , people were excluded from govt social security kinda like pension in india

Increased inflation to reduce the debt value ? ( HOW ?)
