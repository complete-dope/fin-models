## Exceptional Items 

Lets see the suzlon case for exceptional items : 
Company had some OCD's ( Optionally Convertible Debentures ) and CCPS ( Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares ) and now they converted that to equity 

So a debt /liability for which they would have to pay dividend + interest now that got converted to Share capital and suddenly becomes the money that the company can dispense
