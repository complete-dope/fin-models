## Gold

📉 If Dollar Goes Up (Stronger):

Gold becomes more expensive for people outside the US.

That means fewer people buy it, which pushes the gold price down.

So:

💡 Stronger dollar = bad for gold prices

Let’s say you’re looking at a chart that says: “Buy Gold!”

But then you see the dollar is getting stronger.

Even though the chart says “buy,” this big-picture info (macro signal) says:

“Hold on. Gold might actually drop.”

Most commodities (like gold or oil) are priced in US dollars.

If you’re in Europe or Asia, you need to convert your local money to dollars to buy them.

If dollars are expensive, buying gold or oil becomes harder/more costly — fewer people buy = price falls.



## Oil

A country like India or Japan wants to buy oil.

They have rupees or yen, not dollars.

If the dollar gets stronger, they need more local currency to buy the same amount of oil.

That hurts demand. So:

💡 Stronger dollar = bad for oil prices (in most cases)



But Oil isn’t just about currency. It’s also about:

Global demand (economy growing or slowing)

Supply (OPEC, wars, sanctions)

You get a buy signal on your chart for oil.

At the same time:

The dollar is getting stronger ❌ (bad for oil)

But oil prices are still rising ✅

That’s a conflict. It means something bigger is going on — like supply cuts or geopolitical tension driving up oil, even though the strong dollar would normally push it down.



When oil is going up despite a strong dollar, that’s a big macro signal.
It says: “Oil demand is strong or supply is tight — you’re probably underinvested in oil.”
