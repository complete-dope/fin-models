# This is how we figure out financial ratios and work with them !!


## DEFINITIONAL TESTS 

Correctly defined definition of the ration that you are using. Clearly define numerator and the denominator 

Ex: P/E ratio = current market price / Trailing 12 months earnings per share 


## DESCRIPTIVE TESTS 

Understanding the empirical distribution (mean , median) and characteristics of the multiple across universe of companies , feel of what the ratio looks like in real world in the set of companies that you choose   

Ex: 
Things that we will look at : 
1. Average P/E
2. Median P/E
3. Range of P/E
4. Presence of outliers
5. P/E for companies with negative earnings (if any)


Select list of companies from same sector and list down the data from them

## ANALYTICAL TESTS

Principles that drive the multiple. Its about understanding why certain companies have lower and higher ratio compared to others

Ex: 
Get the reason behind high / low value and what fundamental drivers explain differences in P/E ratios among companies

*To get the difference behind these values, lets see what are the primary drivers for this: 
1. Expected growth Rate (g) : Higher growth generally means higher P/E
2. Risk 
3. Payout ratio(1 - Reinvestments) : higher payout , lower reinvestment 


## APPLICATION TEST 
Practical application of the multiple in valuation. Its about how you use the chosen multiple to assess whether a specific asset is under or overvalued 

Based on above data , infer whether the company is overvalued or undervalued




# FINANCIAL RATIOS 

**PE Ratio** : Share price / Earnings per share , how much overvalued is the share price of the company   


**PEG Ratio** : Price to earning ratio that is adjusted for EPS-growth-rate


**Cost of Debt** : Total amount spent to raise debt capital 


**Interest Yield** : Income from interest / Debt on which you need to pay interest 


**Debt to Equity Ratio** : Debt / Equity .. the amount of reliance on debt vs equity that the company 
Debt = current debt + non current debt 
Equity = Shareholder's equity + other Equity ( total equity )


**ROIC** : Return on Invested Capital, the total money invested in the business , total amount / money / profit made from the model 


**Gross Profit** : Revenue - COGS


**Gross Margin** : Gross Profit / Revenue
