DISCOM's : Distribution Companies [LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWbJQtefyeM)



**Regulatory assets** 
Used by elecytricity , gas ,water providers to recover specific costs over time instead of immediately. They exist due to regulatory approvals. 

Ex: Let’s say a utility spends ₹100 crore to upgrade a power grid. Instead of hitting the profit/loss in one year, the regulator allows them to spread the cost over 10 years and recover it via customer bills.

They often have a possibility to get convered to NPA. 

**Subsidiary** : Is when govt. pays a fraction instead of taking it from the consumer

**Cross Subsidiary**: means one group of customers pays more so that another group pays less. 

Ex: Industrial player pays Rs 10 per unit compared to domestic user that pays Rs 6  per unit.

In this case, lets suppose industries have reduced the demands so this leads to cash crunch for the discoms.  
So, they go in debt and are not considered a good business opportunity 


Also low power voltage transmission leads to more cost in transmission compared to high voltage transmission.

```

P = V * I
Low voltage , means high power 

Heat loss = I^2 * R 
Higher current , leads to more heat loss

```

Higher current requires thicker wires to handel current w/o overheating .. cost of copper / aluminium is higher, cost of cable goes up 


Order book : amount of pending orders

Example: 
Installed Capacity aka NamePlate Capacity means what if all conditions are ideal , then the amount of energy produced per hour. 
So, installed capcacity of 100GW translates to around 40GW only due to capacity factor, capacity factor of 0.3-0.4 in India.. 

Company has Order book of 5.5GW that means, under 100% efficiency , in all favourable case, capacity factor of 1 , this the amount of energy produced per hour . 

Energy per hour = 5.5GWh

Real world Capacity factor is 40%, so its: 
5.5 * 0.4 => 2.2GWh


## Wind energy 
Onshore  : Capacity factor of 20-50% , on land 
Offshore : Capacity factor of 40-54% , in between the oceans
