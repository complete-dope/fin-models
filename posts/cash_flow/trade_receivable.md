title : Trade Receivables
---


First mentioned on Balance Sheet, using accural method of accounting which says to register the amount even if you got it or not ..
So as soon as item / product / good sold on half payment /loan it gets registered as Trade receivable


This doesnt mean this much amount you will get ..  
But we write "Balance sheet As at 31st March 2024" , so shouldnt it already include what all we got in the last 12 months , eliminating the need for cash flow statements? 

No, Its rather simple 
Take this example :

--
31st March 2023
Trade receivables = 5,000
--

--
31st March 2024
Trade receivables = 10,000
--

So interpret it like this, 

At the start of the year, we had 5,000 trade receivables
Till the end of the year, we had total of 10,000 trade receivables

So net-net we added 5,000 more in the whole year

Same happens with all receivables, throughtout the finance
